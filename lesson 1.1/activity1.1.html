            <p> My name is Michael Phan and I am currently working as a front
            desk receptionist for a doctor's office. I graduated in 2017 
            with a degree in health sciences. My hobbies included gaming, 
            going to the gym and, more recently, playing volleyball. My goal
            for this bootcamp is to learn a new skill and use that skill to 
            transition into a new career outside of medicine. Hopefully the 
            new career that I step into will allow me with a bit more freedom 
            and flexibility in my schedule.
            </p>
